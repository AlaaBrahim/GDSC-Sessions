Install options : dualboot, wsl, vm
dualboot : system alongside windows, ki yethal l pc yes2lek enehou system eli theb trunnih
+ fast
+ direct access to hardware (exp: carte reseau)
+ comes with preinstalled tools
- complicated to install(Partitioning Required)
- risk to brick your system

wsl(windows subsystem for linux) : linux fi west windows
+ easiet to install 
+/- barebones : only basic stuff is installed => lighter but u need to install tools on your own
- generally used with terminal(can use gui but some config is nec sometimes)
- some features are not supported
- no access to hardware
install tuto (no graphical interface : terminal only):
1) open microsoft store
2) search for wsl and install the first app, reboot recommended
3) search for kali wsl and install the first app
congrats! just type wsl in your terminal(cmd/powershell) and you will be inside your first linux system!
 
virtual machine(vmware/virtual box) : 
+ isolation : seperate from the main os
+ no risk of bricking your system (unlike dualboot)
+ relatively easy setup
+ comes with preinstalled tools
- slow
- no direct access to hardware(still better then wsl)
